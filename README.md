# Watheroo

## Overview


The Weatheroo is a simple application that displays the weather conditions in the city of Jerusalem in an easy and attractive way.
The goal of building the application was to try to integrate many important libraries, the most important of which is the [Axios](https://react.i18next.com/) library, through it we used real data according to [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) website, in addition to using the [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) library, which specializes in many features, including translating web pages.
